üôã About Me

With 8+ years of experience in cybersecurity, cloud security, and network defence, I specialise in protecting hybrid infrastructures and leading security teams. Currently working as a Cybersecurity Engineer ‚Äì Team Lead II, I design and implement cloud security policies, manage Palo Alto firewalls, and automate incident response workflows using Python and Ansible.

My career spans threat detection, vulnerability management, penetration testing, and DevSecOps practices, with a proven track record of improving security posture for enterprise clients. I hold multiple certifications, including AWS Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate, AWS Advanced Networking ‚Äì Speciality, CEH, and PCNSE, which strengthen my ability to secure cloud-native and on-prem environments.

I‚Äôm passionate about mentoring teams, automating security assessments, and aligning solutions with compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, CISA). My goal is to empower organisations to navigate digital transformation securely while reducing risks and enhancing resilience against evolving cyber threats.
