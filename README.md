# About Me

With over 7+ years of experience in cybersecurity and network security, I have a solid background in diagnosing issues and designing solutions.

In my previous roles, I developed security rules and configured devices like Cisco and Juniper. I also automated processes using Python and Ansible, which improved efficiency in managing security. My hands-on experience with firewalls, including Palo Alto, aligns well with the requirements of this role.

I have a strong understanding of network security principles and can lead projects effectively. My ability to communicate complex ideas clearly will help in conducting demonstrations and workshops.

I am excited about the opportunity to help clients navigate their digital transformation journeys. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.
