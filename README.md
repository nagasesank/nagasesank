# About Me

I am a dedicated Security Researcher with over 7+ years of experience in Network & Security Domain. My core strengths lie in problem-solving, verbal communication, and a sharp eye for identifying and investigating potential vulnerabilities in my companyâ€™s products. My role involves conducting internal and external research while collaborating with various departments to ensure the highest product security standards.

As a researcher, I am driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge. I firmly believe that each security vulnerability presents a unique opportunity for learning and growth. I actively explore new security aspects and ensure that my efforts translate into practical, hands-on experience. For me, learning is a continuous process, and I refuse to be confined to a single path or perspective.

I pride myself on my patience and fast learning ability, which I consider essential attributes for both personal and professional success.
